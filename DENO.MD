## Moving to Deno

Removed eslint and prettier and their configs. Needed to ignore any explicit any's. Cleaned up some unused variables.

Can't really move to `deno test`, as my tests are too reliant on jest.

## Deno Build

Had to create a build.ts, but it seems successful at removing rollup; which meant I could remove ~15 packages.

Created a watch mode for the build.ts script without much fuss at all.  `deno run --watch` only watches the script and modules that you call directly, so I had to use the runtime API to use `Deno.watchFs`; it had a problem where it ran modify events three times in a row, so I also imported a recommended debounce script from the std library (versionless because we're all insane: https://jsr.io/@std/async/doc/debounce).

## Deno test

Needed a deno.json file, with "DOM" in "lib".

Needed to run with `unstable-sloppy-imports` to ignore lack of ".ts" extensions.

Needed to add to my tsconfig.json:

```json
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "module": "ES2020",
```

This is because I was running `require('index')` in the index test.

I needed to import tests to a single test file in order for Deno to pick up on Jest types:

`// @deno-types=npm:@types/jest`

## Deno Check

Needed a global.d.ts file to properly type check files, but I also needed to ignore the file for linting:

```ts
// deno-lint-ignore-file
declare var gtag: (...args: unknown[]) => void;

declare var dataLayer: unknown[];

declare var process: NodeJS.Process
```

If I didn't ignore the file for linting I would get:

> error[no-var]: `var` keyword is not allowed.
